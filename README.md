# DND 5e Spellbook
This program calls upon the DND 5e API (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to retrieve spell data based on the user's search queries. 
The user may search by spell name or by a keyword that may appear in any of the API response's fields. The application will
format the information in an easy-to-read manner, meant to be used as a quick reference during DND campaigns.
